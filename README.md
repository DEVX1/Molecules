# Chemozart - Chemistry is art!

Chemozart is a web-based 3d molecule editor and visualization platfrom. This application is available via [chemozart.com](https://chemozart.com). No installation is required and it's accsessible anytime, anywhere which makes this application a proper option for students to draw and view a 3d molecular model. It also offers calculating the force field energy of a molecule with different molecular mechanics methods, thanks to [openbabel-node](https://github.com/mohebifar/openbabel-node) which is basically a port of Open Babel into Node.js.

## Where JavaScript comes to science!
Chemozart is fully written in JavaScript using angularjs, nodejs, express and three.js. A nice simple UI is also implemented in JADE/LESS. This is what makes chemozart different than other existing chemical applications.
